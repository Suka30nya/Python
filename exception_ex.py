# 1) Write a program that creates a dictionary like this 
# {
#     1: "red" , 2: "Blue" , 3: "Orange"
# }
# Now take the key as input from the user and print its corresponding colour 
# (Exception handle the code to terminate gracefully by printing 
# Colour not found if the key doesnot exists )


# d={}
# no_items=int(input("enter the number of items in dictionar"))
# for i in range(0,no_items):
#     key=input("enter keys") 
#     values=input("enter values") 
#     d[key]=values
# print(d)   
# key_var=input("enter key to find its value")
# try:
#  print(d[key_var])

    
# except KeyError:
#     # try:
#     #     key_var=int(input("you entered wronge key!please enter correct"))
#     #     print(d[key_var])
#     # except:
#     #     key_var=int(input("you MAD!!!you entered wronge key!please enter correct"))  
#   print("key not found")   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
#   2) Write a program that creates a list of 5 elements of your choice 
# Now take the index that the user want the data of and print the value at that 
# location 
# Exception handle the code to  terminate gracefully by printing 
# Value not found if the index doesnot exists       


# list1 =input("enter the values seperated by comma").split(",")
# print(list1)
# index_val=int(input("enter the index value"))
# try:
#  print(list1[index_val])
# except IndexError:
#     print("you have entered wrong index")


# 3) Create program that takes age of the user as input 
# and prints number of days that user has lived for 
# Exception handle the code such that if the user has lived for more than 
# 100001 days then user should get the message
# , you lived for so long , may be you will die soon:)

# class mycustom_exception(Exception):
#      pass
# age= int(input("enter your age:"))
# live=age*365

# if live>100001:
#         print("you lived for so long, may be you will die soon!!!!!!!!!")
#         raise mycustom_exception
# else:
#   print("All Good mate , Please live !!!")
  #in process..............
